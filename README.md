# TAG-ME-stimuli

There are 5 types of stimuli in the stimuli folder: Primes (P), in-tune related (ITR), out-of-tune related (OTR), in-tune unrelated (ITU), and out-of-tune unrelated (OTU).
The stimuli groupings are outlined in the excel file. For every prime, there are 4 associated chords (ITR, OTR, ITU, and OTU). There are 12 primes in total, resulting in
48 stimuli pairs. Stimuli for practice trials are the same as stimuli for experimental trials.
